# Contributing
I would love to see people getting involved.<br>
If you have a feature request please create an issue. Also if you're even improving inline-style-prefixer by any kind please don't be shy and send a pull request to let everyone benefit.

### Issues
If you're having any issue please let me know as fast as possible to find a solution a hopefully fix the issue. Try to add as much information as possible such as your environment, exact case, the line of actions to reproduce the issue.

### Pull Requests
If you are creating a pull request, try to use commit messages that are self-explanatory. Also always add some **tests** unless it's totally senseless (add a reason why it's senseless) and test your code before you commit so Travis won't throw errors.
